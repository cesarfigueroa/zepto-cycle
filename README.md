# Zepto Cycle

A small plugin that provides a nifty alternative to the `next` and `prev` Zepto methods.

## Usage

### cycleNext

When traversing a collection, `cycleNext` behaves like `next`. Once it reaches the end, however, it reverts back to the first item in the collection.

### cyclePrev

Similarly, `cyclePrev` behaves like `prev` when traversing a collection. Once it reaches the beginning, it reverts back to the last item in the collection.
